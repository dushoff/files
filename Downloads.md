Downloads was a Dropbox for a long time

Then it was a mirror inside of Nextcloud

Now it is just an orphan directory

Mostly we should come here to clean things up. We already have some things that are more permanent, and which should be mirrors

cp -r ~/Nextcloud/Downloads/picture .

Specifically
* jd/ for stuff about me; e.g. my sig and headshot
* pictures/ for some pictures that wound up here;
* transit/
* attach/
